    Amount of money required for medical treatment of COPD, in 2015 $CAD. For this study,
    we only included direct medical costs, e.g. doctor's visits, medication, hospitalization, etc.
    Indirect costs such as sick days, loss of work, etc. were not included.

      routine care and the treatment of exacerbations; however, costs were calculated separately. </div>

      The overall cost of hospitalisation due to acute exacerbation of COPD was
      obtained from the Ontario Case Costing Project 2000/2001. This cost included laboratory tests and procedures;
      physician-related costs and the costs of additional medications at discharge (antibacterials and prednisone) were added separately.

      Health status utility is a way of measuring value of health. It is a number between 0 and 1,
      with 1 = perfect health and 0 = death. We looked at health utility based on GOLD grades I-IV
      (we had to pool III/IV due to small sample size).

      A QALY is a unit of measuring quality of life in one year based on health.<br>
      1 QALY = 1 year in perfect health <br>
      0.5 QALY = 0.5 years in perfect health, or 1 year in 50% of perfect health<br>
      For this study, we looked at direct reduction in QALY due to exacerbations.
